# 🌸 Instagram Non-Followback Checker (Offline Web Tool)

Tired of following people who don’t follow you back?  
This tool helps you spot those *micro selebs* — all from your Instagram data export 😅  
Runs 100% offline, right in your browser. No logins, no shady servers, no worries 💻✨

## 💡 What Is This?

This is a simple web-based tool that compares:

- Your **following.json**
- Your **followers_1.json**

...and shows you who's not following you back (ಥ﹏ಥ)

Works great with Instagram's official [data download](https://www.instagram.com/download/request/) in JSON format.

## 🛠 How To Use

   - Go to `followers_and_following/`
   - Find: `following.json` and `followers_1.json`
4. Open the web app (see the link above 👆)
5. Upload both files and click "Cek!"
